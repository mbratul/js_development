/*
    Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

    Broadly speaking, JavaScript has four kinds of functions:

    Regular function: can return anything; always runs to completion after invocation
    Generator function: returns a Generator object; can be paused and resumed with the yield operator
    Async function: returns a Promise; can be paused and resumed with the await operator
    Async generator function: returns an AsyncGenerator object; both the await and yield operators can be used

    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}

/* IIFE function */
(function (x) {

/* Function with many parameters */
// this function takes array as a parameter and sum up the numbers in the array
function sumArrayValues(arr) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    sum = sum + arr[i];
  }

//calling a function

/* Arrow Function */

  let area = Math.PI * radius * radius;
