# REST API

The full form of REST API is Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface.

It is an architectural style for designing networked applications that allows different software systems to communicate and share data over the internet.

# Breaking Down the Acronym

Representational: Resources (like a user or a product) are shared between systems as a representation, such as an HTML, JSON, or XML document.

State Transfer: It focuses on transferring the current state of a resource from the server to the client or vice versa.

Application Programming Interface (API): A set of rules and protocols that allow one software program to interact with and use the services of another.

# Key Characteristics

Statelessness: The server does not store any information about the client's state between requests. Every request must contain all the necessary information to be processed.

# HTTP Methods: REST APIs primarily use standard HTTP verbs to perform actions on resources:

GET: Retrieve data from a server.
POST: Create a new resource on the server.
PUT: Update or replace an existing resource.
DELETE: Remove a resource.
PATCH: Partially update a resource.

Uniform Interface: All API requests for the same resource should look identical, regardless of the client (mobile app, browser, etc.).
Common Data Formats: While REST can work with many formats, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the most commonly used format for modern web services because it is lightweight and easy to parse
